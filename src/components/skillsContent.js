I thought it such an interesting aspect of backend development that and I opted to be a mentor for database week in the following cohort. While there are many interesting new alternatives to database storage emerging all the time, I don't suppose the SQL database will go out of fashion anytime soon.",

Joining InFact Coop after graduating meant building several interesting apps with React, Redux, Gatsby and Styled Components. It's awesome to learn a technology that represents such a shift in frontend devleopment, and its existence motivates me to think critically about the tools I use and how they could be adapted and reworked into a totally different development paradigm.",
